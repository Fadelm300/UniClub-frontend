# Difficulties
- Managing and displaying nested channels and subchannels in a clear and intuitive UI.
- Handling real-time updates and synchronization between users (e.g., for posts, comments).

# Future Enhancements
- Improve UI/UX across all pages for a more modern look and better accessibility.
- Add real-time chat or discussion feature within each channel.
- Integrate notifications for comments, replies, or post approvals.
- Allow tagging or searching channels by course code or name.
- Add admin panel for easier content moderation and user management.
- Enable dark mode and theme customization.
